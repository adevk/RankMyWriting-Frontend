# RankMyWriting - Frontend

RankMyWriting is a web app where users can upload their writings, receive votes and scores on them, and also vote on other people's writings. It's similar to **Photofeeler**, but for texts instead of photos. This repository contains the **frontend** part of the application, built using **JavaScript** and **React**.
